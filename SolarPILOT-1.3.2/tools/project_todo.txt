############## DOE FUNDED ######################
----FY16----
* Significantly reduced run time for SolTrace simulations with large numbers of heliostats. Our research is targeting a reduction in run time of 95%.
* Feature enhancements to the SolTrace engine to better integrate with SolarPILOT. These enhancements include:
	* Methods to preserve, interpret, and maximize the utility of ray data generated at each stage in the simulation
	* A simple model for atmospheric scattering
	* Improved technology-specific performance metrics
	* Useful simulation structures such as virtual elements and compound element geometries that ease the definition of receiver apertures and internal surfaces
	* Enabling a surface to emit infrared radiation
* Improved API functionality
* Cross-platform support (OSX, Linux)
----FY17----
* Support for user-specified receiver and heliostat geometries. This enables evaluation of non-rectangular heliostats and receivers with more complex geometry than flat-plate or cylindrical.
* Improved heliostat aim-point strategies. The work targets both the computational efficiency of the aiming algorithms and the uniformity of the resulting receiver flux distribution. Advanced aiming strategies will support multi-zone flux limitations.
* Support for scripting using SAM's LK scripting language.
* Improved plotting and data processing functionality. We plan to develop a widget that allows interactive simulation via a field plot interface such that individual heliostats or groups of heliostats can be evaluated and manipulated.
